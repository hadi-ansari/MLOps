# Machine Learning Pipelines using TFX and Azure ML

This repository contains two directories, one for TFX and one for Azure ML. We have maintained and version controlled the ML notebooks files in this repository.

## TFX

The "Notebooks" directory contains a series of Colab notebooks that provide step-by-step tutorials on building machine learning pipelines using TFX (TensorFlow Extended). These tutorials are organized into five steps, from step 0 to step 5.

In tutorial 0, the tutorial focuses on training a machine learning model using TensorFlow. It serves as a starting point before diving into TFX.

In tutorials 1 to 5, the notebooks progressively integrate more TFX components and showcase different aspects of building a complete ML pipeline. Each tutorial builds upon the previous one, adding new features and demonstrating additional functionalities of TFX. The tutorials cover various stages of the ML pipeline, including data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The "Experiments" directory contains the additional TFX pipeline code for testing purposes.

## Azure ML

This directory contains a collection of Azure ML Notebooks that demonstrate various aspects of building and training machine learning models using Azure ML.

The tutorial 0 showcases the use of Azure ML Designer components to build a machine learning pipeline. It provides a step-by-step guide on how to construct the pipeline in the Azure ML Designer.

The tutorial 1 focuses on training a machine learning model without using a pipeline. It provides instructions on training the model directly without the pipeline infrastructure.

In the tutorial 2, we demonstrate how to build a simple pipeline with two components: Data ingestion and Trainer. It covers the basic steps of constructing a pipeline and executing the necessary data preprocessing and model training tasks.

Building upon the previous tutorial, the tutorial 3 extends the pipeline by adding another component called Evaluator. It demonstrates the evaluation stage of the pipeline, where the trained model is evaluated using appropriate metrics.

### Downloading the dataset
The `How to download the dataset.ipynb` notebook provides instructions on how to download the dataset and prepare the necessary file structure for the dataset. It should only be run if the datasets directory does not exist.
