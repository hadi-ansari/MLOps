This repository contains two directories, one for TFX and one for Azure ML. Both directories have two subdirectories: "Notebooks" and "Experiments". We maintain and version control the ML notebooks files in this repository.

## TFX

The TFX directory contains machine learning pipelines built with TensorFlow Extended (TFX). The "Notebooks" directory contains Colab notebooks that demonstrate how to use TFX to build, train, and deploy machine learning models. The "Experiments" directory contains the additional TFX pipeline code for testing purposes.

## Azure ML (TODO)
